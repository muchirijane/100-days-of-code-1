### Day 33

##### NPM packages and how the internet works

**Today's Progress**

#### How the web Works

The user/client types in the url of a webpage in a browser, the request is sent to the server where the website is hosted then the server sends back the response by getting the webpage content to the client. This is called client-server architecture or Resquest reponse model.

1. First when your enter the domain name it is sent back to DNS Domain Name Server where it gets the real IP address of the website.
   //https://www.google.com/maps to https://216.58.211.206:443. The protocol is http|| https, IP address is 216.58.211.206 and port number is 443 for https || 80 for http.

2. A TCP/IP socket connection is established between the server and the client. TCP is the Transmission Control Protocol and IP is the Internet Protocol, they ddefine how data travels across the web. They set the rules on how data moves across the internet.

3. The Http request is sent to the server. HTTP is Hyper Text Transmission Protocol which is a communication protocol that allows two or more systems to communicate. Http is a protocol that allows the client and server to communicate by sending and receiving messages.
   Types of HTTP methods: (GET/maps HTTP/1.1)

- GET - for requesting data
- post - for sending data
- patch - for modifying data
  The HTTP request has the :
- Start line contains: Http method, request target and http version.
- Http request header has contains Host : www.google.com, User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 and Accepted language - en-us
- Body response only when it's sending data to the server. (POST)

4. A HTTP response is sen back from the server.
   The http response contains:(HTTP/1.1 200 ok)

- Start line with http version, status code and status message.
- Response message
- response body

5. The TCP breaks the HTTP request and response into small chunks called packets before they are sent, then it assemble them into their original request and response. The IP protocol sends and routes all the packets through the internet. It makes sure the packets goes back to their respetive IP addresses.

(Amazing summary notes from Jonas course)

**Results:** I was able to understand how the internet works behind the scenes.

### Day 34

##### NPM packages and how the internet works

**Today's Progress**

#### Static, Dynamic and Api-powered websites

- Static websites have ready files that are served to the browser. Like Html, Css, Jvascript and images files. They display the same content for every user.

- Dynamic website are built on the server each time a new request comes in. It has a database which get the data, with a pre-defined template it builds each page the user requests. From each client based request the page is build with Html, css, images and javascript. This pages are then sent to the browser. This process is also callled server-side rendering. Thus it dynamic beccause the content can change according to the user actions or data in the database. Example is the Twitter website, every time you login you see different tweets.

Web application are dynamic websites with functionality like logging in, signing up or creating profiles.

- API-powered website are websites that have a database that fetches data and its build in two steps:
  a) Building the Api
  b) Consuming the Api
  The Api-powered websites are dynamic websites but the only difference is that Api-powered website send JSON data format to the browser not the entire website. Only the data is sent to the client, no Html,css or js files. When it reaches the browser, it builds the website through the templates created.
  An API is Aplication Programming Interface which is a software that allows application to talk to each other.

(Amazing summary notes from Jonas course)

**Results:** I was able to understand how the internet works behind the scenes.

### Day 44

##### Desigining in Figma

**Today's Progress**

#### Designing beats studio3.

- I have always been using Photoshop or Adobe XD for design but when I started learning how to code during the lockdown, I shifted to Figma. Most because of the code snipped thay have. It makes it easier to code faster when you can see the height and width of your component in each frame. I used the bests by Dre offical website to get an inspiration to create another version of it but for only the skyline collection. I have always loved the quality of these headphones used them once when watching a movie and I immediately fell in love with them. Hope I will have enough money to buy one or two someday.

**Results:** ‚úç Created the skyline collection website for beats by Dre and made different frames from desktop to mobile. It always good to make website responsive.

### Day 45-46

##### Coding in Figma

**Today's Progress**

#### Building beats studio3.

- The past three days have been helpful. I was able to starting a real small website project that I designed in Figma. I wanted to go through the whole process of sketching, responsive design in figma to coding the website. I used Tailwind CSS a Css framework to learn and practice. The only way to I understand is by doing and seeing everything detail completed to the end. I used some custom css style like the colors, insets, rems, font family and font sizes to ensure the coded website looked like the design (Talkimg about making things pixel perfect. hahaha). I never used min-width in my coding, so it took a minute before I got used to it. But I can say I love Tailind Css and I will be using it more in my projects.

**Results:** ‚úç Coded a responsive website with Tailwind Css called [Beats studio3](https://github.com/muchirijane/Beats-studio3) by Beats by Dre. 

<!-- ![dev to blog post](assets/img/day-44.png) -->
