### My Goals

At the end of this challenge i would love to have learnt the following:

- Gsap Animation
- Object Oriented Programming in JS
- Create more front-end websites
- Learn Vue/react js
- Node Js
- Improve in refactoring code and degugging

This are the sections I am going to focus on to improve my front end skills. I hope during or by the end of the challange I will have a job in front end development or freelancing.

### Day 33

##### NPM packages and how the internet works

**Today's Progress**

#### How the web Works

The user/client types in the url of a webpage in a browser, the request is sent to the server where the website is hosted then the server sends back the response by getting the webpage content to the client. This is called client-server architecture or Resquest reponse model.

1. First when your enter the domain name it is sent back to DNS Domain Name Server where it gets the real IP address of the website.
   //https://www.google.com/maps to https://216.58.211.206:443. The protocol is http|| https, IP address is 216.58.211.206 and port number is 443 for https || 80 for http.

2. A TCP/IP socket connection is established between the server and the client. TCP is the Transmission Control Protocol and IP is the Internet Protocol, they ddefine how data travels across the web. They set the rules on how data moves across the internet.

3. The Http request is sent to the server. HTTP is Hyper Text Transmission Protocol which is a communication protocol that allows two or more systems to communicate. Http is a protocol that allows the client and server to communicate by sending and receiving messages.
   Types of HTTP methods: (GET/maps HTTP/1.1)

- GET - for requesting data
- post - for sending data
- patch - for modifying data
  The HTTP request has the :
- Start line contains: Http method, request target and http version.
- Http request header has contains Host : www.google.com, User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 and Accepted language - en-us
- Body response only when it's sending data to the server. (POST)

4. A HTTP response is sen back from the server.
   The http response contains:(HTTP/1.1 200 ok)

- Start line with http version, status code and status message.
- Response message
- response body

5. The TCP breaks the HTTP request and response into small chunks called packets before they are sent, then it assemble them into their original request and response. The IP protocol sends and routes all the packets through the internet. It makes sure the packets goes back to their respetive IP addresses.

(Amazing summary notes from Jonas course)

**Results:** I was able to understand how the internet works behind the scenes.

### Day 34

##### NPM packages and how the internet works

**Today's Progress**

#### Static, Dynamic and Api-powered websites

- Static websites have ready files that are served to the browser. Like Html, Css, Jvascript and images files. They display the same content for every user.

- Dynamic website are built on the server each time a new request comes in. It has a database which get the data, with a pre-defined template it builds each page the user requests. From each client based request the page is build with Html, css, images and javascript. This pages are then sent to the browser. This process is also callled server-side rendering. Thus it dynamic beccause the content can change according to the user actions or data in the database. Example is the Twitter website, every time you login you see different tweets.

Web application are dynamic websites with functionality like logging in, signing up or creating profiles.

- API-powered website are websites that have a database that fetches data and its build in two steps:
  a) Building the Api
  b) Consuming the Api
  The Api-powered websites are dynamic websites but the only difference is that Api-powered website send JSON data format to the browser not the entire website. Only the data is sent to the client, no Html,css or js files. When it reaches the browser, it builds the website through the templates created.
  An API is Aplication Programming Interface which is a software that allows application to talk to each other.

(Amazing summary notes from Jonas course)

**Results:** I was able to understand how the internet works behind the scenes.

### Day 35

##### Blog post

**Today's Progress**

#### Learning how to code through github repository.

- I created a blog post where I shared github resources that I have found useful over the time I am coding. It's always good to share with the community and help other code newbies out. To be honest I wish I had found these resources earlier in my journey but that's why I wrote it, to help others.

**Results:** ‚úç Dev.to blog post [Learning how to code through GitHub repository](https://dev.to/tracycss/learning-code-through-github-repositories-2bp7)
